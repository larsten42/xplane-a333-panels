# vendor/

Third-party UI component libraries, used as-is. Nothing in here is ours to
edit — if something about a vendored file needs to change, that change
belongs on the upstream (Design's) side, not here, so an update stays a
plain file swap instead of a merge.

## fcu-instruments.js

The FCU/EFIS panel component library ("Claude Design"'s vanilla build —
native Web Components, zero dependencies, no build step; see its own top
comment). Defines `<fcu-panel>`, `<efis-panel>`, and their constituent
pieces (`<fcu-knob>`, `<seven-seg>`, etc.) as custom elements, each exposing
an imperative JS API (`window.fcuPanel`, `window.fcu`, `window.efis`) that
`src/fcu-panel.js` and `src/efis-panel.js` wire up to the real X-Plane
adapters.

**To update when a new bundle arrives:**

1. Drop the new bundle wherever's convenient (e.g. `frontend-bundle/`,
   gitignored, not part of the app).
2. Copy just the library file over this one:
   `cp frontend-bundle/vanilla/fcu-instruments.js vendor/fcu-instruments.js`
3. Reload and sanity-check the FCU/EFIS panels.
4. If the new version renamed or restructured any button/knob/lever ids,
   or changed method names/signatures, `src/fcu-panel.js` and/or
   `src/efis-panel.js` will need matching updates — check their own top
   comments for the exact API surface each depends on, and diff the new
   bundle's `INTEGRATION.md` against the previous one to see what moved.

That's the whole process — no build step, no merge, nothing else in the
app should need to change unless the component API itself changed.
